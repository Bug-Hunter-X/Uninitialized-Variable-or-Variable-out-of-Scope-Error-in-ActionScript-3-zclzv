This repository contains an example of an uninitialized variable error in ActionScript 3 and a solution to fix it. The bug is demonstrated in the file `bug.as`, and the solution is shown in `bugSolution.as`. The error occurs because a variable is used without first being initialized with a value. The solution involves checking if the variable is initialized before accessing it.
